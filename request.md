# Python Script Request: Analyze RFdiffusion PDBs

## Objective
Develop a Python script to analyze PDB files generated by RFdiffusion in comparison to an original PDB file, focusing on identifying unaligned "GGG...GGG" regions (likely linker/scaffold insertions).

## Inputs
1.  **Original PDB:** Path to a single PDB file (e.g., `original.pdb`) that was used as input *before* RFdiffusion.
2.  **Generated PDBs Directory:** Path to a directory containing multiple PDB files that are outputs *after* RFdiffusion.

## Steps

### 1. Organize Generated PDBs by Length
   - Read all PDB files from the "Generated PDBs Directory".
   - For each generated PDB, extract its full protein sequence.
   - Group the PDBs into subdirectories based on their protein sequence length. For example, all PDBs with sequences of length 150 would go into a directory named `length_150/`.

### 2. Analyze Each Length Group

   - For each subdirectory (each length group):
     - Select one representative PDB file from that group. The selection criteria can be arbitrary (e.g., the first one encountered).
     - Extract the protein sequence from this representative generated PDB.

### 3. Sequence Alignment

   - Align the sequence of the selected representative generated PDB with the sequence of the "Original PDB".
   - The alignment should identify insertions, deletions, and matches.

### 4. Identify Unaligned "GGG...GGG" Regions

   - After alignment, locate continuous stretches of 'G' (Glycine) residues in the *generated* PDB sequence that correspond to an insertion or mismatch relative to the *original* PDB sequence (i.e., they don't align with residues in the original PDB). This specifically means stretches like "GGG...GGG".

### 5. Output Chain ID and Positions

   - For each identified "GGG...GGG" region in the representative generated PDB:
     - Determine the Chain ID(s) associated with this region.
     - Determine the exact residue start and end positions (based on the PDB numbering) of this region within its chain.
     - Print the Chain ID and the range of residue positions for each identified unaligned 'G' segment.
